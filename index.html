              Most of the time when I teach HTML to a group of students, they make webpages about something they are interested in - 
              a band, recipe, place or something like that. People always have something to say, and love saying it to the public online.

              Invariably (in the US at least) <i>someone</i> in the group picks their dog, or dogs in general. People find common ground with
              learning partners around animals and pets, and it intenet offers a plethora of pictures of dogs, and puppies, to include in a
              webpage project.

              No offense of could to cats and kittens, but in my experience people more often want to showcase their dogs in my classes
              than cats. I don't what that says about cat vs. dog owners, but that's been my observation.
